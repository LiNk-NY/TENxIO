\title{TENxH5: Import H5 files from 10X}
\usage{
TENxH5(resource, version, group, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{resource}{character(1) The path to the file}

\item{version}{character(1) There are currently two recognized versions
associated with 10X data, either version "2" or "3". See details for more
information.}

\item{group}{character(1) The HDF5 group embedded within the file structure,
this is usually either the "matrix" or "outs" group but other groups are
supported as well (e.g., "mm10").}

\item{...}{Additional inputs to the low level class generator functions}
}
\description{
This constructor function was developed using the PBMC 3K dataset from 10X
Genomics (verison 3). Other versions are supported and input arguments
\code{version} and \code{group} can be overridden.
}
\details{
The data version "3" mainly includes a "matrix" group and "interval"
information within the file. Version "2" data does not include
ranged-based information and has a different directory structure compared
to version "3". See the internal \code{data.frame}: \code{TENxIO:::gene.meta} for
a map of fields and their corresponding file locations within the H5 file.
This map is used to create the \code{rowData} structure from the file.

h5f <- "~/data/10x/pbmc_3k/pbmc_granulocyte_sorted_3k_filtered_feature_bc_matrix.h5"
